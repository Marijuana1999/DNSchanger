## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
1. The app **may request Administrator privileges** ‚Äì this is required for DNS and firewall changes.  
2. If you see errors when applying DNS/region changes, press **Continue**, then close and restart the app.  
3. **Do not install the program in Drive C:** ‚Äì use another location to avoid permission issues.  
4. If antivirus shows a warning during region setup, it is safe: the app only creates firewall rules to block foreign IP ranges.  
5. DNSChanger contains **no malware, hidden processes, or dangerous code** ‚Äì only the functions described here.
